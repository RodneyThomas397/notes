<h1>Force Notes</h1>
<br>
<h2>What is a Force?</h2>
<p>A force is a push or pull that can make an object move</p>
<br>
</h2>What is mass?<h2>
<p>Mass is the measure of how many atoms an object has, this is a fixed value, it does not change based on location. </p>
<br>
<h2>What is weight?</h2>
<p>Weight is the force of gravity pulling an object down</p>
<br>
<h2>Are mass and weight the same?</h2>
<p>No!!! Mass is value that does not change, an object no matter where it is will always have the same amount of stuff, weight is dependent on and changes with gravity </p>
<br>
<h2>Time to activate your brain!</h2>
<p>If I have a 10kg cannonball on earth and I find a way to get it to the moon:</p>
<p>What happens to mass of the cannon ball?</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>3.    What happens to the weight of the cannonball on the moon?</h2>
<p>Mass stays the same, the overall “size” of the cannonball does not change from the moon to earth</p>
<p>Weight will change, the cannonball will weigh less on the moon due to a smaller gravity</p>
<br>

<h2>Newton’s 1st Law of Motion</h2>
<p>An object in motion stays in motion until acted upon by an outside force.  An object at rest, stays at rest until acted upon by an outside force.</p>
